# fusieshow-timers

This simple Matlab code creates GIF countdown timers for the world population and the oil reserves, for use at the start of the Fusieshow presentation.
makeCountdown.m creates a general timer, and Countdowns_Fusieshow.m contains some examples to create the timers specifically for the world population and the oil reserves on the show dates in 2023.

If you convert the GIF to mp4 externally (for example at https://cloudconvert.com/gif-to-mp4), the file size decreases significantly.
